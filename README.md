# Keygen_HWID_validation
Simple script to authenticate users

Tried to look for something like this yesterday but didn't find anything appropriate, so I made my own one.
This is just a bare basic login validation, you will still have to encrypt your distributable if you want to secure it from being easily stolen.

There probably is a lot to improve and extend, like handling appending new HWIDs automatically to your main file. But sadly this isn't possible with pastebin.
Also mind when testing, there is a limit of 20 pastes a day for non whitelisted users.
