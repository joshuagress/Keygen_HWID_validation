# Keygen_HWID_validation
Simple script to authenticate users

Tried to look for something like this yesterday but didn't find anything appropriate, so I made my own one.
This is just a basic login validation, you will still have to encrypt your distributable if you want to secure it from being easily stolen.
There probably is a lot to improve and extend, but this was done in a few hours last day, so feel free.
